Food Wars is a Python game created during the JourneyHacks 2025 hackathon. Inspired by the famous Space Wars game, players control a rocketship that shoots gummy bears at incoming donuts in a fast-paced, sugary battle. As the game progresses, the challenge intensifies with more candies coming at the player, requiring quick reflexes and strategy to survive. The vibrant, fun visuals and upbeat soundtrack make this game a sweet experience for candy lovers and gamers alike.
